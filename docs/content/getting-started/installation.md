# Installation

The extension is not yet published on the VS Code Marketplace. Install it by building a `.vsix` package from source.

## Package from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ai-engineering-coach.git
cd ai-engineering-coach
npm install
npm run package
```

This produces a `.vsix` file in the project root.

## Install the .vsix

From the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension ai-engineer-coach-*.vsix
```

Or open the Extensions panel in VS Code, click the `...` menu, choose **Install from VSIX...**, and select the file.

## Development

To run the extension in development mode instead, use `npm run build` and press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

## Standalone CLI

The same package also builds a standalone Node.js CLI for environments where opening VS Code is not practical:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js summary --harness gigacode
```

To install the CLI command from a local checkout:

```bash
npm install -g .
ai-engineer-coach summary --harness gigacode
```

By default, the CLI reads GigaCode sessions from the standard projects directory:

| OS | Default GigaCode projects directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `$HOME/.gigacode/projects` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.gigacode\projects` |
| Linux / SberOS | `$HOME/.gigacode/projects` |

If the logs are stored elsewhere, pass the directory explicitly:

```bash
ai-engineer-coach summary --harness gigacode --path /path/to/.gigacode/projects
```

For non-interactive setup, use an environment variable:

```bash
AI_ENGINEER_COACH_GIGACODE_PROJECTS=/path/to/.gigacode/projects ai-engineer-coach summary --harness gigacode
```

The CLI can also find the `gigacode` executable in `PATH` for diagnostics, but analytics are based on the session log files, not on the executable path.

## Opening the Dashboard

After installation, open the Command Palette and run:

```
AI Engineer Coach: Open Dashboard
```

You can also click the AI Engineer Coach icon in the Activity Bar (sidebar) if it appears there.

## Configuration

AI Engineer Coach works out of the box with sensible defaults. Optional settings are available under `aiEngineerCoach.*` in VS Code settings to control cache behavior, date ranges, and workspace filtering.
